dont forget to add/fix the following

names at the top of every widget and window, let the client know who they are and maybe who theyre talking to --- done the first part

graceful deaths, something isnt workinga bout when your friend your chatting with closes

exit buttons that are connected to things -- done

client should have a flag, shouldSendDeathToServer so when a clientName is taken we arent sending a remove me signal -- done

when the server closes it sends the message "Server has closed". we want the clients to know to display a message or do something when that happens.  -- done

setup close event on chatWindow.cpp -- done

selection window needs to read S: message and know it cant connect to those in converstaiont

communcation needs a message for E:  end converstaion so those people join the seleectable list again
