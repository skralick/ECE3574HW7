dont forget to add/fix the following

names at the top of every widget and window, let the client know who they are and maybe who theyre talking to

graceful deaths, something isnt workinga bout when your friend your chatting with closes

exit buttons that are connected to things

client should have a flag, should sendDeathToServer so when a clientName is taken we arent sending a remove me signal

when the server closes it sends the message "Server has closed". we want the clients to know to display a message or do something when that happens. 

setup close event on chatWindow.cpp
